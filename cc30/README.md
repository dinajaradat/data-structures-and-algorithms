#  Hash Tables

# Approach & Efficiency
### set(key, value): It hashes the key to determine the index in the underlying collection where the key-value pair should be stored.
### get(key): get the pair of the given key.
### has(key): returns a boolean value indicating whether the key exists in the hash table.
### keys(): returns a collection of all the keys stored in the hash table. 
### hash(key): calculate the index where the key should store in the array.
